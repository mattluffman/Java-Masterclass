    /**
     * Write a method named printFactors with one parameter of type int named number.
     * If number is < 1, the method should print "Invalid Value".
     * The method should print all factors of the number. A factor of a number is an integer which divides that number wholly
     * (i.e. without leaving a remainder).
     *
     * For example, 3 is a factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without leaving a remainder. In other words 6 / 3 = 2.
     *
     *
     * EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:
     *
     * * printFactors(6); → should print 1 2 3 6
     * * printFactors(32); → should print 1 2 4 8 16 32
     * * printFactors(10); → should print 1 2 5 10
     * * printFactors(-1); → should print "Invalid Value" since number is < 1
     *
     *
     * HINT: Use a while or for loop.
     * NOTE: When printing numbers, each number can be in its own line. They don't have to be separated by a space.
     *
     * For example, the printout for printFactors(10); can be:
     *
     * 1
     * 2
     * 5
     * 10
     *
     * NOTE: The method printFactors should be defined as public static like we have been doing so far in the course.
     * NOTE: Do not add a main method to the solution code.
