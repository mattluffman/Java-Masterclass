     * Create a program using arrays that sorts a list of integers in descending order.
     * Descending order is highest value to lowest.
     * In other words if the array had the values in it 106, 26, 81, 5, 15 your program should
     * ultimately have an array with 106,81,26, 15, 5 in it.
     * Set up the program so that the numbers to sort are read in from the keyboard.
     * Implement the following methods - getIntegers, printArray, and sortIntegers
     * getIntegers returns an array of entered integers from keyboard
     * printArray prints out the contents of the array
     * and sortIntegers should sort the array and return a new array containing the sorted numbers
     * you will have to figure out how to copy the array elements from the passed array into a new
     * array and sort them and return the new sorted array.
